  bio: `I'm interested in personalization, proactive intelligence, and generative interfaces. I care deeply about my work's ability to impact everyday people.

Currently, I'm building <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/Ob1-claybird-the-full-stack-ai-ad-company" target="_blank">Claybird</a> - we use AI video models to generate and retarget hyper-personal ads. We work with brands like Coca-Cola, Mercor, Delve, and Eight Sleep, and are backed by <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=Fall%202025" target="_blank">YC</a>, <a href="https://lsvp.com/" target="_blank">Lightspeed</a>, and <a href="https://www.susaventures.com/" target="_blank">Susa Ventures</a>.

Previously, I was at Google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=do+a+barrell+roll" target="_blank">Search</a>, designing cool AI features for the results page that anticipate user intent.

Before that, I built ML infrastructure for <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12443859?hl=en" target="_blank">conversion modeling</a>, pioneering a DNN-based approach to joining billions of unattributed clicks across the web. Our 4-person team drove $1B in revenue for Google in 2024.

I studied at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/michigan-vs-washington-national-championship-live-score-updates-result/4zScDGVEEHc6/TFk4C5ScmFNd/" target="_blank">Michigan</a> and took a gap year to join <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/agape" target="_blank">Agapè</a> as employee #2. We built a viral growth loop that scaled the product to 200k+ users, caught Michael Seibel's attention, and got us into YC S21.

Earlier, I developed a distributed compression algorithm for imaging silicon wafers at <a href="https://www.kla.com/products/wafer-manufacturing" target="_blank">KLA</a> and worked on designing <a href="https://pharos.jstor.org/" target="_blank">Pharos</a> at JSTOR.org.

I also researched high-energy physics models at CERN and BNL with <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/abidmalik" target="_blank">Abid Malik</a>, optimizing distributed training on Summit, then the world's fastest supercomputer. I presented at <a href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/index.html" target="_blank">Supercomputing '19</a>.`,
